  <p id="about-intro"> I am a <strong>software engineer</strong> and <a href="publications.html">open source advocate</a> based in Taipei, Taiwan. I work for Mozilla to build browsers.  I spent most of my time on software <a href="project.html">side projects</a> and listens to classical music.  I got my M.S. at National Taiwan University in Computer Science, focused on computer music; and I had a B.S. in Electrical Engineer and Financial Engineering.
