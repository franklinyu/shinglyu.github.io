               <h3>Music</h3>
               <p>I always try to combine my love for music and technology. My research topic has always been related to music, for example, <b>Computer Expressive Performance</b> and <b>Automatic score-following</b>.  And during my MediaTek summer internship I have tuned several <b>MIDI wavetables</b> for feature phones of various price range. I can even squeeze all the sounds needed in a 7 KB MIDI wavetable.</p>
               <p>I am a regular (classical) concert-goer. I have wrote some articles for MUZIK magazine. I also plays <b>Guitar</b> and <b>Ukulele</b>.</p>
