* The problem => Waste time on fb

I always find myself mindlessly browsing Facebook or Feedly (RSS reader) for way too long. Although I know there is nothing new on Facebook, I still can't fight the temptation of a Dopamine surge, which results in reduced productivity. If you've read the book _[The Willpower Instinct_](TBD), you'll know that the willpower is like a muscle, even trivial decisions like resisting to check Facebook will deplete the strength of your willpower "muscle", which eventually makes you give in to the temptation or something much worse, like skip exercise or break your diet, because you'll willpower was worn done. One way to prevent this is to reduce the exposure to potential cues. When you subconsciously open Facebook, it's super likely that you'll be attracted by the posts and photos, and starts to drift away from your "flow". But if Facebook is blocked, you'll probably shrug and get back to work.


I've tried various schedule-based blocking solutions, like [LeechBlock](TBD) and GNOME [Nanny](TBD). But the problem with schedule-based method is that it's not flexible enough. My preferred schedule is roughly like: open for 10 minutes, then block for the next 50 minutes. Setting up this kind of schedule is way too much work. And if you finish your big chunk of work at, say 10:45, but your open time slot is 11:00 to 11:10, then you can't "borrow" the 10 minutes from future time slots.
* Theory => The willpower instinct.
* Why the old method doesn't work => total block, can't search; Timed, too unflexable
* Our solution => Start counting when you open it
* WebExtension migration
* Future directions
  * Better add blacklist UI
* Call to action => Download
